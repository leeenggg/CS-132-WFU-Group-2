        This project aims to analyze the state of water access and quality in

        It seeks to identify the political, economic, and environmental factors
        that affect people’s access to clean and safe water. By comparing the

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Access to quality water remains uneven in the Philippines. Rapid
            urbanization, political issues, and natural disasters all affect the
            water quality in the country. This study aims to identify the effect
            of urbanization on water quality, quantify accessibility between
            rural and urban communities, and identify limiting factors that
            hinder access to clean water.

              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>
                Access to clean and safe water is a basic human need; many
                Filipinos still struggle with limited or unsafe sources. This
                motivated the study to better understand drivers of unequal
                access.

            <div class="panel">
              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                Unequal access to quality water persists, especially between
                urban and rural areas. Political, economic, and environmental
                factors hinder sustainable water systems.

              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                The project compares current conditions and global strategies to
                identify practical, equitable approaches to improve water
                quality, availability, and management.

              <p>
                1. How does urbanization impact water quality in the
                Philippines?

              <br />
              <p>

              <h3>RQ1 Analysis</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Plot Analysis</strong>
                <br />
                The scatter plot shows a clear positive relationship. The red regression line trends upwards, indicating that regions with a higher urbanization rate (further to the right) tend to have a higher percentage of "Safely Managed" water access (higher up).

                For example, we can see highly rural regions like MIMAROPA (28% urban) and Bicol Region (22% urban) in the bottom-left quadrant, with "Safely Managed" access rates around 25-30%. In contrast, highly urbanized regions like Central Luzon (56% urban) are in the top-right, with access rates above 60%.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Hypothesis Test Analysis:</strong>
                <br />
                Pearson Correlation (r): 0.7039
                This value indicates a strong positive linear correlation between urbanization and "Safely Managed" water access. <br>
                P-value: 0.0106
                Since 0.0106 &lt; 0.05 (our significance level), the result is statistically significant.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br />
                We reject the null hypothesis. The data provides strong evidence that a region's urbanization rate has a significant positive effect on its level of "Safely Managed" water access. This plot and statistic directly answer the first research question.

              <h3>RQ2 Analysis</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Plot Analysis</strong>
                <br />
                The scatter plot shows the relationship between a region's economic growth (GDP Growth %) and its "Safely Managed" water access. The red regression line is nearly flat, but slightly positive, suggesting a very weak upward trend.

                Visually, the points are scattered widely. For example, Central Luzon has a high GDP growth (5.6%) and high water access (67%), which supports the hypothesis. However, Central Visayas has an even higher GDP growth (6.2%) but lower water access (59%). This wide spread indicates that the relationship is not strong or clear.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Hypothesis Test Analysis:</strong>
                <br />
                Pearson Correlation (r): 0.1983
                This value indicates a very weak positive linear correlation. A value this close to 0 suggests that there is almost no linear relationship between the two variables. <br>
                P-value: 0.5376
                This p-value is very high, and significantly greater than our 0.05 significance level.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br />
                We fail to reject the null hypothesis. The data shows no statistically significant linear correlation between a region's GDP growth rate and its "Safely Managed" water access.

                This directly answers the research question: based on the data, economic growth does not appear to be a significant factor in explaining the differences in quality water access across regions. This is a very important finding.

              <p>
                <strong>Plot Analysis</strong>
                <br />
                X-Axis: The regions are sorted from most rural (like Bicol Region) on the left to most urban (like Central Luzon) on the right. <br>
                Y-Axis: Shows the 100% composition of water access for each region.
                As you move from left to right, you can visually see the dark blue bar (`Safely_Managed_2024`) grow larger, while the light blue bar (`Basic_2024`) shrinks.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br />
                This single plot demonstrates the project's key finding: urbanization is strongly linked to a shift from "Basic" water access to "Safely Managed" water access. This answers both the research questions in one clear, compelling visual.
