          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Access to quality water remains uneven in the Philippines. Rapid
            urbanization, political issues, and natural disasters all affect the
            water quality in the country. This study aims to identify the effect
            of urbanization on water quality, quantify accessibility between
            rural and urban communities, and identify limiting factors that
            hinder access to clean water.

              <p>
                Access to clean and safe water is a basic human need; many
                Filipinos still struggle with limited or unsafe sources. This
                motivated the study to better understand drivers of unequal
                access.

              <h3>RQ1 Analysis</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Plot Analysis</strong>
                <br />
                The scatter plot shows a clear positive relationship. The red
                regression line trends upwards, indicating that regions with a
                higher urbanization rate (further to the right) tend to have a
                higher percentage of "Safely Managed" water access (higher up).
                For example, we can see highly rural regions like MIMAROPA (28%
                urban) and Bicol Region (22% urban) in the bottom-left quadrant,
                with "Safely Managed" access rates around 25-30%. In contrast,
                highly urbanized regions like Central Luzon (56% urban) are in
                the top-right, with access rates above 60%.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Hypothesis Test Analysis:</strong>
                <br />
                Pearson Correlation (r): 0.7039 This value indicates a strong
                positive linear correlation between urbanization and "Safely
                Managed" water access. <br />
                P-value: 0.0106 Since 0.0106 &lt; 0.05 (our significance level),
                the result is statistically significant.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br />
                We reject the null hypothesis. The data provides strong evidence
                that a region's urbanization rate has a significant positive
                effect on its level of "Safely Managed" water access. This plot
                and statistic directly answer the first research question.

              <p>
                <strong>Plot Analysis</strong>
                <br />
                The scatter plot shows the relationship between a region's
                economic growth (GDP Growth %) and its "Safely Managed" water
                access. The red regression line is nearly flat, but slightly
                positive, suggesting a very weak upward trend. Visually, the
                points are scattered widely. For example, Central Luzon has a
                high GDP growth (5.6%) and high water access (67%), which
                supports the hypothesis. However, Central Visayas has an even
                higher GDP growth (6.2%) but lower water access (59%). This wide
                spread indicates that the relationship is not strong or clear.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Hypothesis Test Analysis:</strong>
                <br />
                Pearson Correlation (r): 0.1983 This value indicates a very weak
                positive linear correlation. A value this close to 0 suggests
                that there is almost no linear relationship between the two
                variables. <br />
                P-value: 0.5376 This p-value is very high, and significantly
                greater than our 0.05 significance level.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br />
                We fail to reject the null hypothesis. The data shows no
                statistically significant linear correlation between a region's
                GDP growth rate and its "Safely Managed" water access. This
                directly answers the research question: based on the data,
                economic growth does not appear to be a significant factor in
                explaining the differences in quality water access across
                regions. This is a very important finding.

              <h3>Nutshell Analysis</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Plot Analysis</strong>
                <br />
                X-Axis: The regions are sorted from most rural (like Bicol
                Region) on the left to most urban (like Central Luzon) on the
                right. <br />
                Y-Axis: Shows the 100% composition of water access for each
                region. As you move from left to right, you can visually see the
                dark blue bar (`Safely_Managed_2024`) grow larger, while the
                light blue bar (`Basic_2024`) shrinks.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br />
                This single plot demonstrates the project's key finding:
                urbanization is strongly linked to a shift from "Basic" water
                access to "Safely Managed" water access. This answers both the
                research questions in one clear, compelling visual.
